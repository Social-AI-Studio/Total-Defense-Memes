### Scrapping Reddit Data

#### 1. Install Dependencies: Install Dependencies (It's big list hence I would suggest to install only those which are required manually). 
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### 2. Run the scraper for specific time window

- `python scrape_reddit.py --subreddit memes --before 1663673457 --after 1641036174`
